This is a reddit client written in python

Right now you can view any subreddit, order post by hot or new, show a limited number of posts, open a link, display some help, exit the program.

To display help write "help" as a command.

This was done just for fun, don't expect anything special.

To run it you can either clone the repo or downlaod the redditClient.py file using python.
