This is a reddit client written in python

Right now you can view any subreddit, order post by hot or new, show a limited number of posts, open a link, display some help, exit the program.

To display help write "help" as a command.

This was done just for fun, don't expect anything special.

I know I could have used the PRAW modules but I did it the hard way because I wanted to have some fun with JSON & Co.
The parameters for a command are done the wrong way, there is probably some kind of libraby that does it for me in a better way. 
I was also looking to include a login functionality, but it is currently on hold.


To run it you can either clone the repo or downlaod the redditClient.py file and then running it using python.
It works like a console, you write and th program does what you said.
